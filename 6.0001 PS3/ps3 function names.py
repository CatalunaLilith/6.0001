def load_words():
    """
    Returns a list of valid words. Words are strings of lowercase letters.
    
    Depending on the size of the word list, this function may
    take a while to finish.

def get_frequency_dict(sequence):
    """
    Returns a dictionary where the keys are elements of the sequence
    and the values are integer counts, for the number of times that
    an element is repeated in the sequence.

def get_word_score(word, n):
    """
    Returns the score for a word. Assumes the word is a
    valid word.

    You may assume that the input word is always either a string of letters, 
    or the empty string "". You may not assume that the string will only contain 
    lowercase letters, so you will have to handle uppercase and mixed case strings 
    appropriately. 

	The score for a word is the product of two components:

	The first component is the sum of the points for letters in the word.
	The second component is the larger of:
            1, or
            7*wordlen - 3*(n-wordlen), where wordlen is the length of the word
            and n is the hand length when the word was played

	Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is
	worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.

    n: int >= 0

def display_hand(hand):
    """
    Displays the letters currently in the hand.

    For example:
       display_hand({'a':1, 'x':2, 'l':3, 'e':1})
    Should print out something like:
       a x x l l l e
    The order of the letters is unimportant.

    hand: dictionary (string -> int)
    no return, only print
    """

def deal_hand(n):
    """
    Returns a random hand containing n lowercase letters.
    ceil(n/3) letters in the hand should be VOWELS (note,
    ceil(n/3) means the smallest integer not less than n/3).

    Hands are represented as dictionaries. The keys are
    letters and the values are the number of times the
    particular letter is repeated in that hand.

    n: int >= 0
    returns: hand  dictionary (string -> int)
    """

def update_hand(hand, word):
    """
    Does NOT assume that hand contains every letter in word at least as
    many times as the letter appears in word. Letters in word that don't
    appear in hand should be ignored. Letters that appear in word more times
    than in hand should never result in a negative count; instead, set the
    count in the returned hand to 0 (or remove the letter from the
    dictionary, depending on how your code is structured). 

    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.

    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.

def play_hand(hand, word_list):

    """
    Allows the user to play the given hand, as follows:

    * The hand is displayed.
    
    * The user may input a word.

    * When any word is entered (valid or invalid), it uses up letters
      from the hand.

    * An invalid word is rejected, and a message is displayed asking
      the user to choose another word.

    * After every valid word: the score for that word is displayed,
      the remaining letters in the hand are displayed, and the user
      is asked to input another word.

    * The sum of the word scores is displayed when the hand finishes.

    * The hand finishes when there are no more unused letters.
      The user can also finish playing the hand by inputing two 
      exclamation points (the string '!!') instead of a word.

def substitute_hand(hand, letter):
    """ 
    Allow the user to replace all copies of one letter in the hand (chosen by user)
    with a new letter chosen from the VOWELS and CONSONANTS at random. The new letter
    should be different from user's choice, and should not be any of the letters
    already in the hand.

    If user provide a letter not in the hand, the hand should be the same.

    Has no side effects: does not mutate hand.

    For example:
        substitute_hand({'h':1, 'e':1, 'l':2, 'o':1}, 'l')
    might return:
        {'h':1, 'e':1, 'o':1, 'x':2} -> if the new letter is 'x'
    The new letter should not be 'h', 'e', 'l', or 'o' since those letters were
    already in the hand.
